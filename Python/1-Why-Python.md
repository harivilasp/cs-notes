# Why Python

## Features

* open source,
* interpreted,
* high level language and
* provides great approach for object-oriented programming
* interactive mode of Python makes its simple to test codes
* large standard library and community support
* simple to extend the code by appending new modules that are implemented in other compiled language like C++ or C
* expressive language
  * possible to embed into applications to offer a programmable interface
  * easy to write code that's easy to understand, both for the compiler and for a human reader.
  * Two factors that make for expressiveness:
    * intuitively readable constructs
    * lack of boilerplate code

## Why

* platform independent
* ease of use
* simple syntax
* more suited for quick prototyping
* versatile - great libraries to deal with data science applications
* deep learning frameworks available with Python APIs
* rapidly upgrading

## Data Science Libraries

Some of the most commonly used data science libraries are as follows:

### NumPy

* provides mathematical function to handle large dimension array
* provides various method/function for Array, Metrics, and linear algebra
* NumPy stands for Numerical Python
* provides vectorization of mathematical operations on the NumPy array type, which enhance performance and speeds up the execution

### Pandas

* data manipulation and analysis
* useful functions to manipulate large amount of structured data
* Two main data structures in Pandas:
  * Series - one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type
  * DataFrame - two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns)

### Matplotlib

* library for Data Visualization

### Scipy

* provides great functionality to scientific mathematics and computing programming
* contains sub-modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, Statmodel and other tasks common in science and engineering.

### Scikit-learn

* library for machine learning
* built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
* easy and simple tools for data mining and data analysis
