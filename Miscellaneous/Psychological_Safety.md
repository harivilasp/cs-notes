# Why high performing teams need psychological safety

* the belief that you won't be punished when you make a mistake
* allows for moderate risk-taking, speaking your mind, creativity
* when we feel safe => we become more open-minded, resilient, motivated, and persistent

## Steps

1. Approach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary 
   1. everyone hates losing
   2. need to accommodate a "learning" and curiosity-driven mindset
   3. Think about, "How could we achieve a mutually desirable outcome?"
2. Speak human to human 
   1. even in the most contentious negotiations, the other party is just like us and wants to walk away happy
   2. Try the "Just like me" reflection, e.g., "This person has hopes, anxieties, and vulnerabilities, just like me."
3. Anticipate reactions and plan countermoves. 
   1. avoid triggering a fight-or-flight reaction prior to conflicts
   2. "act first, think later" brain structure shuts down perspective and analytical reasoning
   3. anticipate reactions, plan countermoves, and adopt a learning mindset
   4. "If I position my point in this manner, what are the possible objections, and how would I respond to those counterarguments?"
4. Replace blame with curiosity 
   1. If you believe you already know what the other person is thinking, you're not ready to have a conversation.
   2. adopt a learning mindset, knowing you don't have all the facts
   3. State the problematic behavior neutrally and factually, e.g., "progress appears to be slowing on your project."
   4. Engage your subordinates in exploration, e.g., "we could uncover what went wrong together?"
   5. Ask for a solution, e.g., "What do you think needs to happen here?" followed by "How can I support you?"
5. Ask for feedback on delivery 
   1. What worked and what didn't work in my delivery?
   2. How did it feel to hear this message?
   3. How could I have presented it more effectively?
6. Measure psychological safety 
   1. Ask your team how they feel
   2. take surveys on psychological safety as a team
   3. Ask your team, "How confident are you that you won't receive retaliation or criticism if you admit an error or make a mistake?"
