# Good Developers Are Practical Not Emotional

* It is not the problem itself but our reaction to it that causes misery in our lives
* A developer needs to **practically respond** (stop and think about what he needs to face) to situations instead of reacting to them
* The key is to **experience uncomfortable emotions** but **not get stuck** in them. Emotions have the ability to cloud our judgment

## Managing emotions

### Challenge the deadlines

* Do not reject them
* Take a **proactive solution-based tone** while reacting to unreasonable deadlines
  * Work backward from the deadline and **map out** realistically as to how much work can be done by you or others and by when.
  * **Highlight the dependencies** carefully well in advance. For example, “I can finish the code for the loans module but the ATM switch code needs to be in place before that.”
  * **Break the deadline** up into a series of small milestones and set yourself a deadline for each. This will keep you motivated and on track towards the final deadline.
  * The key to questioning deadlines is educating yourself about the real **purpose**. Is there any pressing need for this urgency? Are they aware of the quality impact of the deadline? Are they lacking any information which they should know? Question the intent until you can get the real reason and suggest a solution towards it.
  * Lastly **say ‘NO’** if the deadline is really unreasonable - Your superiors will respect you more if you insist on quality rather than compromising on a rush job.
* Remember at the end of the day you are a **professional** and a professional does the right thing always even in situations when he is under pressure to do the wrong. Be a professional.

### Prioritize ruthlessly

* Urgency-important Table:

    | **Urgent** | **Important** |                                                                                                 |
    | ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Yes        | Yes           | Topmost priority.                                                                               |
    | Yes        | No            | Calls, meetings and any activity which is not helping you to meet your deadline. Postpone them. |
    | No         | Yes           | Can wait or can be delegated.                                                                   |
    | No         | No            | **Don’t waste your time** on this.                                                              |

### Decide to Have a Growth Mindset

* The only way to deal with fear: you need to **face it, head-on**
* When you face your fears they become less frightening
* **Honor the strength of your past** - Remember the struggles and the effort put in by you that made you such a great developer.
* And rather than focusing on the difficulties you are facing, focus on what the experience can teach you. 
* Make a conscious effort to absorb the learnings rather than getting bogged down by frustration.

### Communicate, Communicate and Communicate

* Communication. It’s about **honesty**. It’s about treating people in the organization as deserving to know the facts. You don’t try to give them half the story. You don’t try to hide the story. You treat them as…as true equals, and you communicate and communicate and communicate.
